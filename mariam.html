						<h3><strong>My Background</strong></h3>
						<p class="background">I came from sales.  I was ready for a new challenge.  I was ready to learn something new.  Working in the start-up world really helped me understand was dev was truly about.  So, here I am, a student with no programming skills, in a programming boot camp!  If I can do it at over 30 years old, you can too!</p>
