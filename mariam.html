					<h3 class="about-me">About Me</h3>
					<p class="profile">I am from the Golden State that is California.  We have a bad rap but our rap is pretty good. I mean, look at Tupac!  I have lived in a few other states and currently reside in Portland, Oregon.  With a family of friends here I have found myself creating a whole new life and am very proud to call Portland my home.</p>

						<h3>Background</h3>
						<p class="background">I came from sales.  I was ready for a new challenge.  I was ready to learn something new.  Working in the start-up world really helped me understand was dev was truly about.  So, here I am, a student with no programming skills, in a programming boot camp!  If I can do it at over 30 years old, you can too!</p>
